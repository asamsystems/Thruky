# Thruk
Bootstrap 3 wrapped theme and plugin for Thruk Monitoring (http://www.thruk.org)
I have created theme 'Asam' and plugin 'conf_asam'. The idea is to leave as much code a possible untouched while trying to wrap them in Bootstrap. Unfortunately the wrapping has made it version dependent.

# Version
To find the theme/plugin suitable for your installed Thruk version have a look at the Github Release/Tag.
Eg. Tag 2.30-3_1 means this theme/plugin is for Thruk version 2.30-3. the `_1` indicates the theme/plugin update sequence.
